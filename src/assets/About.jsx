            The inception of &apos;Kaagazz&apos;, unlike most popular rolling paper brands, has an influence that is deeply rooted in the South-Asian heritage that precedes us. India has a very rich and often overlooked history of its own when it comes to the culture. A history that is a part of our identity.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            &apos;Kaagazz&apos; rolling paper is the perfect blend between the rich, ancient Indian past and the boundless future that lies ahead. &apos;Kaagazz&apos; is a premium rolling paper brand, purely made so that you can have an experience unlike any other, with a paper that is vegan, eco-friendly and very easy to use.

            At &apos;Kaagazz&apos; we firmly believe in giving back to the community that we come from and helping make changes at the grassroots level. We donate a considerable amount of our annual proceeds to NGOs that help and support women through their daily struggles, we believe in giving back to our community every chance we get. We want to pay homage to the rich &apos;Naari&apos; culture that we come from, which inspires us to rethink and question the norms, and we want to make sure we take these values into the future with us.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            At &apos;Kaagazz&apos;, we try very hard to provide an accessible platform for change. We hope to be a part of the growing renaissance we see in our culture through a growing appreciation of art and artists, and we hope you come along with us for the ride.
